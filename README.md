Problem Statement:

A retail company wants to visualize their customer data in a 3D space to
better understand the relationship between customer age, annual spending,
and loyalty points.
Your task is to create a 3D scatter plot using Python that represents this
data.
The company has provided you with the following requirements:
Generate random data for 100 customers with the following attributes:
Age: between 18 and 80 years old
Annual Spending: between $100 and $10,000
Loyalty Points: between 0 and 1000 points
Create a 3D scatter plot where:
X-axis represents Age
Y-axis represents Annual Spending
Z-axis represents Loyalty Points
Each point should represent a customer.
Use different colors for points based on age groups:
18-30: Red
31-50: Green
51-80: Blue
Add appropriate labels, title, and a legend to the plot.
Ensure the plot is visually appealing and easy to interpret.
Your code should include data generation and visualization in a single
script.
Focus on efficient data manipulation and visualization techniques in
Python.
